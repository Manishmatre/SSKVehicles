# Technical Documentation

This document provides detailed technical information about the Vehicle Management System codebase.

## Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture using React. It uses the Context API for state management and React Router for navigation.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Context API for State Management**: Instead of using Redux or other state management libraries, the application uses React's built-in Context API for simplicity and to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

2. **Local Storage for Data Persistence**: For demonstration purposes, the application uses browser's local storage to persist data. In a production environment, this would be replaced with a backend API.

3. **Protected Routes**: The application implements protected routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain pages.

4. **Responsive Design**: The UI is built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive design that works well on all device sizes.

## Component Structure

### Authentication Components

#### `Login.jsx`

The Login component handles user authentication:

- Uses the `useAuth` hook to access the authentication context
- Implements form validation for email and password
- Displays error messages for invalid inputs
- Shows loading state during authentication
- Redirects to the admin dashboard upon successful login

#### `Signup.jsx`

The Signup component handles user registration:

- Uses the `useAuth` hook to access the authentication context
- Implements form validation for full name, email, password, and confirm password
- Displays error messages for invalid inputs
- Shows loading state during registration
- Redirects to the admin dashboard upon successful registration

### Layout Components

#### `Header.jsx`

The Header component displays the application header:

- Shows the application logo
- Displays the current user's name
- Provides a logout button
- Uses the `useAuth` hook to access the current user and logout function

#### `Sidebar.jsx`

The Sidebar component provides navigation:

- Contains links to all major sections of the application
- Highlights the current active section
- Collapses on smaller screens for better mobile experience

#### `ProtectedRoute.jsx`

The ProtectedRoute component protects routes from unauthorized access:

- Uses the `useAuth` hook to check if the user is authenticated
- Redirects to the login page if the user is not authenticated
- Renders the protected component if the user is authenticated

### Vehicle Management Components

#### `VehicleManagment.jsx`

The VehicleManagement component displays the vehicle management dashboard:

- Uses the `useVehicle` hook to access vehicle data
- Implements search and filter functionality
- Displays vehicle statistics
- Shows a table of vehicles with actions
- Provides links to add, view, update, and delete vehicles

#### `AddVehicleForm.jsx`

The AddVehicleForm component allows users to add new vehicles:

- Uses the `useVehicle` hook to access the addVehicle function
- Implements form validation for all required fields
- Displays error messages for invalid inputs
- Shows loading state during form submission
- Redirects to the vehicle details page upon successful submission

## Context Providers

### `AuthContext.jsx`

The AuthContext provides authentication state and functions:

- Manages user authentication state
- Provides login, signup, and logout functions
- Stores user information in local storage
- Exposes the current user and authentication status

### `VehicleContext.jsx`

The VehicleContext provides vehicle data and functions:

- Manages vehicle data state
- Provides functions to add, update, and delete vehicles
- Provides functions to add maintenance, fuel, and insurance records
- Stores vehicle data in local storage
- Exposes vehicle data and functions to components

## Data Models

### User Model

```javascript
{
  id: string,
  fullName: string,
  email: string,
  password: string, // Hashed in a real application
  role: string // 'admin', 'manager', 'user'
}
```

### Vehicle Model

```javascript
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  number: string,
  type: string,
  make: string,
  model: string,
  year: string,
  status: string, // 'Active', 'Under Maintenance', 'Insurance Expired'
  insuranceExpireDate: string, // ISO date string
  renewDate: string, // ISO date string
  lastMaintenance: string, // ISO date string
  nextMaintenance: string, // ISO date string
  mileage: number,
  maintenanceHistory: [
    {
      id: number,
      date: string, // ISO date string
      type: string,
      cost: number,
      provider: string,
      notes: string
    }
  ],
  fuelHistory: [
    {
      id: number,
      date: string, // ISO date string
      amount: number,
      cost: number,
      odometer: number,
      location: string
    }
  ],
  insuranceHistory: [
    {
      id: number,
      date: string, // ISO date string
      policyNumber: string,
      provider: string,
      coverage: string,
      expiryDate: string, // ISO date string
      renewDate: string, // ISO date string
      premium: number
    }
  ]
}
```

## Routing

The application uses React Router for navigation. The routes are defined in `App.jsx`:

```javascript
<Routes>
  {/* Public routes */}
  <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
  <Route path="/signup" element={<Signup />} />
  
  {/* Protected routes */}
  <Route element={<ProtectedRoute />}>
    <Route path="/" element={<Navigate to="/admin-dashboard" />} />
    <Route path="/admin-dashboard" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
    <Route path="/vehicles-dashboard" element={<VehicleManagment />} />
    <Route path="/add-vehicle" element={<AddVehicleForm />} />
    <Route path="/vehicle-details/:id" element={<VehicleDetails />} />
    {/* Other protected routes */}
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

## State Management

### Authentication State

The authentication state is managed by the `AuthContext`:

```javascript
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

// Check if user is logged in on initial load
useEffect(() => {
  const storedUser = localStorage.getItem('user');
  if (storedUser) {
    setUser(JSON.parse(storedUser));
  }
  setLoading(false);
}, []);

// Login function
const login = async (email, password) => {
  // Implementation
};

// Signup function
const signup = async (userData) => {
  // Implementation
};

// Logout function
const logout = () => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### Vehicle State

The vehicle state is managed by the `VehicleContext`:

```javascript
const [vehicles, setVehicles] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);

// Load vehicles from localStorage on initial render
useEffect(() => {
  // Implementation
}, []);

// Save vehicles to localStorage whenever they change
useEffect(() => {
  // Implementation
}, [vehicles]);

// Add a new vehicle
const addVehicle = (newVehicle) => {
  // Implementation
};

// Update an existing vehicle
const updateVehicle = (updatedVehicle) => {
  // Implementation
};

// Delete a vehicle
const deleteVehicle = (id) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

## Form Handling

The application uses controlled components for form handling:

```javascript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  name: '',
  number: '',
  type: '',
  // Other form fields
});

const handleChange = (e) => {
  const { name, value } = e.target;
  setFormData({
    ...formData,
    [name]: value,
  });
  // Clear error when user starts typing
  if (errors[name]) {
    setErrors({
      ...errors,
      [name]: "",
    });
  }
};

const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  if (!validateForm()) {
    return;
  }
  
  setIsLoading(true);
  
  try {
    // Submit form data
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

## Error Handling

The application implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Form Validation**: All forms include validation to ensure data integrity.
2. **API Errors**: Errors from API calls are caught and displayed to the user.
3. **Loading States**: Loading states are shown during asynchronous operations.
4. **Error Boundaries**: React Error Boundaries could be implemented to catch rendering errors.

## Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling:

- **Utility Classes**: Tailwind's utility classes are used for styling components.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind's responsive prefixes are used to ensure the UI works well on all device sizes.
- **Custom Components**: Some custom components are created for reuse across the application.

## Testing

The application could be tested using:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions.
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the entire application flow.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to various platforms:

1. **Static Hosting**: The application can be built and deployed to static hosting services like Netlify or Vercel.
2. **Docker**: The application can be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment.
3. **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment can be set up for automated testing and deployment.

## Performance Optimization

The application implements several performance optimizations:

1. **Code Splitting**: React Router's code splitting is used to load only the necessary code for each route.
2. **Memoization**: React's `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks could be used to memoize expensive calculations and functions.
3. **Lazy Loading**: Components could be lazy loaded to reduce the initial bundle size.

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security measures:

1. **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users can access certain routes.
2. **Form Validation**: All forms include validation to prevent malicious input.
3. **Local Storage**: Sensitive data is not stored in local storage.
4. **HTTPS**: The application should be served over HTTPS in production.

## Accessibility

The application follows accessibility best practices:

1. **Semantic HTML**: Semantic HTML elements are used for better screen reader support.
2. **ARIA Attributes**: ARIA attributes are used to provide additional information to screen readers.
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: The application can be navigated using a keyboard.
4. **Color Contrast**: Sufficient color contrast is maintained for better readability.

## Internationalization

The application could be internationalized using:

1. **i18next**: A popular internationalization framework for React.
2. **Language Files**: Separate language files for each supported language.
3. **Locale Detection**: Automatic detection of the user's preferred language.
